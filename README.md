## Motivation

Car accidents are a major public health concern, causing significant numbers of deaths and injuries every year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for people aged 1-54 in the United States. In 2019, over 36,000 people died in car accidents in the US, and millions more were injured. These accidents not only have devastating personal and emotional impacts, but they also have significant economic costs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the economic cost of motor vehicle crashes in the US was over $800 billion in 2020, including costs such as medical expenses, lost productivity, and property damage. Reducing the number of car accidents, deaths, and injuries is therefore a crucial goal, with the potential to save lives and reduce economic burden.

## Application

Geo-spatial analytics and data science techniques can play a vital role in identifying where reoccurring car accidents are happening. Doing so may help to identify local interventions which may support reducing the number of accidents. By analyzing accident data with geographic information, it is possible to identify patterns and trends in the location and frequency of accidents. For example, geo-spatial data analysis can be used to identify hotspots, or areas with a high concentration of accidents, which may be caused by factors such as poor road design, high traffic volumes, or high speeds.

Data science techniques, such as machine learning and predictive modeling, can also be used to identify factors that contribute to the likelihood of an accident occurring at a particular location. For example, data on weather conditions, road conditions, traffic volumes, and other factors can be used to build models that predict the likelihood of an accident occurring at a particular location. This information can be used to inform the development of interventions aimed at reducing the number of accidents in high-risk areas.

By identifying where reoccurring accidents are occurring and understanding the factors that contribute to these accidents, geo-spatial analytics and data science techniques can help policymakers and other stakeholders develop targeted interventions to reduce the number of car accidents, deaths, and injuries. These interventions may include measures such as improved road design, traffic calming measures, or educational campaigns to promote safe driving practices.
